<center><h3>SYNOPSIS</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For decades universities have delivered instruction over long distances
through correspondence courses. During the decade of the 1990s developments in technology offered new delivery vehicles for correspondence
courses. Internet courses, where the interaction between faculty and student<br>

occurs primarily over the Internet, represent a substantial departure from the
traditional learning model. The growth in college and university offerings of
Internet courses has been phenomenal and, as that growth accelerates, some
writers have predicted that the university, as we now know it, will cease to
exist. There is little doubt that distance learning with Internet courses will
have an impact on the traditional university and a very important question is,
will Internet courses represent a new and significant improvement over
traditional pedagogy for educating students or just a lessening in the rigor of
academic programs?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter presents the attitudes of accounting department chairpersons and College of Business (COB) deans on Internet courses. In the view of
the nearly 65% of the chairs and almost half of the deans, Internet courses are
simply correspondence courses presented with new technology. Those who
agree that Internet courses are correspondence courses are more negative on
offering Internet courses in university programs or offering degrees through
the completion of only Internet courses.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results of this research suggest that, while the traditional university
will face some challenges from the distance learning revolution, its
survival will not be in jeopardy. Rather, the challenge may well be
integrating the new technology without significantly diminishing the
quality of the educational process.<br>
<center><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance learning is not a new instructional model for universities,
only the delivery techniques are evolving. For decades universities have
delivered instruction over long distances through correspondence courses.
Typically these courses required a student to finish a specific program of
relatively independent study and successfully complete one or more
exams. These exams were, almost universally, proctored by an independent third party. Although correspondence courses have been offered by
a number of universities, the percentage of universities offering these
courses is relatively small. Additionally, correspondence courses have
never obtained the same degree of acceptance as traditional on-campus
courses requiring a student’s attendance and participation. Perhaps that is
why they have not been a threat to the traditional on-campus model of
instruction. Schools that have offered a degree completely by correspondence have typically not been mainstream colleges and universities, but
tend to have offered paraprofessional degrees.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 1990s developments in technology offered new delivery
vehicles for correspondence courses. With the rapid spread of the Internet and
email, universities seemed to sense a source of previously untapped revenue,
offering courses to anyone in the world who had a computer and an Internet
connection. Some jargon had to be added to describe the new environment so
terms like, “distance learning” and “Internet courses” were added to the
academic lexicon. Distance learning, where an instructor is in a location
remote from that of the student, could apply to a number of different delivery
schemes. New technology has allowed students to complete a course from a
remote site using a telephone line or a satellite uplink. Television (TV)
courses were available previously but they were not interactive. New technology allows the faculty and student to communicate, both verbally and
visually, in real-time. Internet courses represent an even greater departure
from the traditional learning model by allowing a student anywhere in the
world to complete a course by using the Internet and Email. Universities have
an initial investment in the development of an Internet course but the
continuing cost of repeatedly offering the course is small compared to the
potential revenue. Unless the course is revised the incremental cost to the
university for offering the course to additional students is primarily to
compensate the instructor. A virtually unlimited number of students can be
added with minimal utilization of investment in additional fixed assets.<br>
<h3>Problems with Internet Courses</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the traditional controls available with correspondence courses
are not as easily implemented with Internet courses. Proctoring of exams
has been the norm with university correspondence courses and with
television courses. With TV courses a technical person is usually required
at each site to keep the equipment functioning, so proctoring is typically
not a problem. However, with Internet courses proctoring becomes much
more difficult. One real advantage of Internet courses is bringing education to persons in extremely remote locations, and this poses problems in
locating certifiable proctors. Traditionally, proctors have been credentialed educators who were neutral with respect to the student. In population centers this type of proctor is not too difficult to locate, but in the
frozen tundra of Alaska or the sweltering outback of Australia, it may be
impossible. In effect, when a university offers an Internet course with no
required campus visits, it gives up virtually all of the traditional controls
over the course and accepts on faith that the student receiving credit for
the course is the same person who completes the assignments.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps to a greater degree than for correspondence courses, Internet
courses are appropriate only for students who are highly motivated and
capable of working independently with a minimum of personal instruction. Smith (2000) discussed some of the advantages and disadvantages of
Internet courses and pointed out, among others, the following disadvantages:<br>
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet courses are not for all students.
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students must have the requisite computer skills to complete an
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet course.
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face-to-face interaction is missing.
4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses must be prepared in detail and approved before being offered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and are rather unyielding to change.
5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communications must be very precise and many students and faculties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are not proficient at communicating explicitly.
<h3>Growth of Internet Courses</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the challenges that Internet courses present, colleges and
universities would be expected to proceed cautiously and test carefully
before implementing Internet courses and degree programs. To the contrary, however, they have activated courses and programs at a surprising
rate. The 1993 Peterson’s College Guide listed 93 ‘cyberschools’ and the
1997 Distance Learning Guide lists 762. That represents a phenomenal
growth of more than 700 percent. Forbes reports that “in December 1999,
the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) of the U.S. Department of Education (USDE) released a national survey on what it calls
‘distance learning’ in higher education. In 1997-98 almost 44% of all
higher education institutions offered distance courses. Larger institutions
were moving faster; 87% of those with more than 10,000 students offered
distance classes, while only 19% of institutions with fewer than 3,000
students did so. Total enrollment in post-secondary, credit-granting distance
learning courses in 1997-98 was 1,363,670; the number has grown considerably since, although as yet there are no firm figures” (Forbes, 2000). The
American Federation of Teachers indicated that “distance education is one of
the fastest-growing developments in higher education. Seventy percent of the
nation’s 4,000 two- and four-year colleges offered online courses in 2000, up
from 48% in 1998” (Black Issues in Higher Education, 2001). There is little
doubt that the number of colleges and universities offering electronic courses
(Internet courses) is growing rapidly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Projections call for 2.2 million students to be enrolled in Internet courses
by 2002 and by 2005 it is expected to be a $46 billion business. Small wonder<br>

that universities, not wanting to be seen as followers, are abandoning their
traditionally conservative approach and rushing headlong to cash in on the
lottery. Their actions are reminiscent of the avaricious appetite of the dot-com
investors in 1999 before the bubble burst in 2000.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the phenomenal growth in college and university offerings of Internet
courses continues and more institutions offer Internet degrees completely
through the Internet, some writers have predicted that the university, as we
now know it, will cease to exist. In his article Electronics and the Dim Future
of the University, Noam (1996) says that:<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of prospering with the new tools (communications technologies),<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many of the traditional functions of universities will be<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;superseded, their financial base eroded, their technology replaced<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their role in intellectual inquiry reduced.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is little doubt that offering E-courses and E-degrees represents <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a dramatic departure from the traditional university teaching<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model. The new direction may be fueled by fiscal and political<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;considerations rather than educational...If the university’s dominance<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; falters, its economic foundations will erode.</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance learning, utilizing Internet courses, may or may not represent the future for universities, but there can be little doubt that Internet
courses will have an impact on the traditional university. Perhaps the
conventional wisdom is to embrace the trend in the hope of surviving as
a viable institution.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As researchers speculate on the impact that Internet courses and
programs will have on the traditional university, there is a very important
question that is rarely asked aloud. That question is, “Do Internet courses
represent a new and significant improvement over traditional pedagogy
for educating students or just a lessening in the rigor of academic
programs?” Substantial research is needed to answer that question over a
time frame of several years. In the shorter term, faculty and administrators
of universities will have a major influence on whether Internet courses
will be an improvement or a detriment to the educational process. They
will play a vital role in crafting Internet courses and programs for their
respective universities and their attitudes may provide a glimpse of the
future impact of distance learning on the traditional university.
<h3>Attitudes of Accounting Chairpersons and COB Deans</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to determine the attitudes of accounting department chairpersons
and College of Business (COB) deans, an email questionnaire, containing 17
statements relating to Internet courses, was sent to 341 university accounting<br>

department chairpersons and 334 COB deans in the U. S. The questionnaire
contained 17 statements, relating to Internet courses, with five Likert-type
response categories ranging from “Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree.”
The questionnaire sent to the deans contained two additional questions, with
“yes and no” response categories, that related to whether the school currently
offered, or planned to offer, Internet courses. No effort was made to slant
either questions or response categories in a direction that might influence
responses and no effort was made to detect any response bias from the
question arrangement or the direction of the response categories. In this study
the terms “Internet course” and “E-course” were considered interchangeable.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questionnaires were sent via email over the Internet and three different
response modes were suggested. Thirty-six of the questionnaires sent to
chairpersons were undeliverable because of email address problems that
could not be resolved, resulting in 305 valid questionnaires sent. A total of 94
usable responses was received, 18 from the web site, 9 through the post office,
and 67 directly from the respondent on the Internet. Most of the responses that
were received via the U.S. Postal Service were mailed in an envelope with the
university’s return address on it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighty of the questionnaires sent to COB deans were undeliverable
resulting in 254 questionnaires delivered to the deans. Sixty-six of the 254
deans who received a questionnaire responded, 23 on the web site, 22 through
the United States Postal Service (USPS), and 21 via email. Most of the
responses that were received via the USPS were mailed in an envelope with
the university’s return address on it. Apparently, with both chairpersons and
deans, anonymity was not the major motivation in using this mode of
response. The 94 responses from chairpersons yielded a response rate of
30.8% and the 66 responses from deans yielded a response rates of 26.0%.
<h3>Offering Internet Courses</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 1 contains the questions and the percentage of responses in each
response category for chairpersons and deans. The “Strongly Agree” and
“Agree” categories and the “Strongly Disagree” and “Disagree” categories were combined in order to make the data easier to comprehend. Also,
a one-way ANOVA was run on the data to determine if the responses of
the two groups differed significantly. Table 2 contains the questions, the
ANOVA results, and the percentage of responses in each combined
response category.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first statement said that “Except for the delivery medium E courses
are essentially correspondence courses,” and almost 65% of chairpersons and
42% of deans agreed or strongly agreed. Only 25% of chairpersons and 48%
